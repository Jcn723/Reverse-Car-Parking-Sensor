# Reverse-Car-Parking-Sensor
I decided to make this reverse parking sensor project to prevent the damage and accidents caused by lack of attention. 
In this project I described the working and the design of my Arduino project called as reverse parking system.

Material required-
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic ping sensor
- breadboard
- Piezo buzzer 
- jumper wires
- Glue and tapes

Installation 
one can place and install this sensor module under the rear car bumper. it will be a good place for this. There will be no need to worry about permanent power source. One could be able to change the battery anytime and reinstall it again according to his need or connect to the charge plugin socket of vehicle.

Conclusion
Car safety is an important concerned around the world. Remembering my own car incident in my mind it was must for me make a project related car safety. My aim of the project was to create something which can help the car drivers to get back to the focus while driving if they got diverted while parking. The main cause of car accident was the diversion of mind so this Arduino based car reverse parking sensor will help to avoid car collision while creating a loud beep sound which will help the driver to see the obstacle behind the car and help to avoid the collision. This project is very useful for the safety of the car as well as of driver.
